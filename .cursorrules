        - Define service architecture and components
    @todo.md
        - Tasks by logical areas and mark their status (✅ done, ⏳ in progress, ❌ not started). Next priority tasks in the end.
        - Prefer full stack tasks.
    @ai_changelog.md
        - Changelog of changes done

</documentation>

<actions>
  <document>
     Scan, read and update documents under documentation tag according to instructions.
  </document>

  <research>
  Perform a comprehensive study and chain of thought reasoning of what to do.
    1. read_file @description for context and @architecture.md for folder structure. Consider correct folders and files on where to implement changes.
    2. Always consider the end-to-end implementation, think changes needed for UI, API queries, backend and database.
    3. list_dir for all relevant folders
    4. execute codebase_search for finding relevant files and methods first for getting context. Don't make assumptions.
    5. Search the web using Tavily tool for up-to-date documentation and getting started.
    6. After you have all the context, perform chain of thoughts using this format:
      6.1. "Reading required files..."
      6.2. "Analysis: what I found in the files..."
      6.3. "Plan: what needs to be done, what tools I need..."
      6.4. "Need more info: what more do I need to know..."
      6.5. "Implementation: how I'll do it..."
    7. If you need more information or clarifications, please stop and ask me before proceeding to next step
    8. Update documentation defined in <documentation> and write a tasklist to todo.md
  </research>

  <fix>
  Perform a comprehensive study and chain of thought reasoning of what might cause the error and fix it.
    1. read_file learnings.md from the docs folder if you have an ready solutions for this
    2. Read all url's present in the error description
    3. Then search the web for the quick error resolutions.
    4. Perform chain of thoughts reasoning for the cause and potential fixes for the error
    5. Fix and validate the error
  </fix>

  <validate>
  Write comprehensive tests, run them and fix any errors
   1. read_file architecture.md for understanding of code structure and test practises
   2. write unit tests for the feature
   3. execute unit tests and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   4. write e2e tests for the feature
   5. execute e2e and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   6. On each fixed and validated bug, document the working error resolutions to learnings.md, including any links that you found usable.
   7. Repeat until all tests succeed
  </validate>

  <record>
   1. write summary of what you did in the ai_changelog.md and update the todo list in the todo.md (do not remove any tasks, just update their status)
  </record>

  <design>
   1. read_file frontend.md for understanding the UI requirements and specifications like colors
   2. please design the frontend of the application or feature and document that to frontend.md
   3. generate any images or illustrations needed in the feature
   4. optimise the generated images
   5. write short instructions for the developer to communicate the design and images
  </design>

  <implement>
   1. Perform a research in <research> tag until I explicitly tell to continue to design phase
   2. Perform a design process until I explicitly tell to continue to implementation phase
   3. Develop the full e2e code changes for the requested feature
   4. Perform a validate process
   5. Record the results
  </implement>

  <invent>
    1. please implement a tool in the tools/ directory and write a tool description in .cursorrules file.
    2. Execute the tool and fix any errors until it succesfully returns the results you wanted
  </invent>

  <commit>
    1. please commit all pending changes using git add . and git commit with descriptive message
  </commit>
</actions>

<important>
Important rules:
- Do not ever create a new project, scan the folders to understand the project structure.
- Do not rely on your current knowledge about libraries, always search the web for up-to-date information
</important>

Now, considering above actions, analyse the intent and actions needed and first say what actions you are executing and execute them thoroughly according to instructions.
Start by planning your task using example:
---
I'm performing <main process name> / <sub process name>, current step is <sub sub process name>. In this process I'll execute following steps:
- <step 1>
- <step 2>

Next phase is:
- <process name / next sub process> when <conditions to continue>
